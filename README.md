Extracting-and-Visualizing-Stock-Data

I use the  y-finance API to obtain the stock ticker and extract information about the stock.

A final project for the course Python Project for Data Science where 
I extract the profit data for Tesla and GameStop and build a dashboard
to compare the price of the stock vs the profit for the hedge fund.
